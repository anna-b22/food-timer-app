Project Description
ANY TIME(R) is a website designed to allow its users to set timer for specific food according to their needs. The user has to enter the name of the food and set the timer for it to cook. The app notifies the user when the time is up! It can also be used to access any recipes around the globe.
The Problem Statement 
Ever forgotten about the egg you left to boil? Do you remember the timings for soft and hard boiled eggs? If your answer is no, then we have the solution!
Quick and easy to access recipe search included!

The Solution 
To remind the users about the timings of different food to cook, the ANY TIME(R) website allows you to set timers for the same. User needs to enter the food item's name and it's timing must be set appropriately and when the time is up the message will be shown.
It also gives the user a vast variety of recipes for anything and everything from Indian to Japanese cuisine. Now detailed recipes are just a finger tip away without spending minutes searching on the web for the right one.
